Viewing Failure as an Opportunity for Growth
--------------------------------------------

Viewing failure as an opportunity for growth is a critical component of developing a growth mindset in embellishment. Rather than seeing failure as a negative outcome, individuals with a growth mindset view it as an opportunity to learn and improve.
